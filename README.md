This application is a general-purpose hash detection code with currently two functions:

1. Wordlist Generation: It can create passwords of the desired length containing English or Turkish alphabets and numbers. It offers options for lowercase/uppercase letters and numbers.

2. Hash Cracking: In this section, hash cracking is performed using a previously generated wordlist. The code is currently tailored for PeopleSoft hashes.

If you have any specific corrections or further details to add, please let me know.
